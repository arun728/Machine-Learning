Big O Notation

Big O(1) - Constant
Big log(N) - going thru half the size of n
Big O(N) - size of n, for loop and while loops - 2 separate for and while loops 
Big(N^2) - Two nested for and while loops

Arrays

Low level arrays - each unicode character in python will be assigned a cell in memory which is of size 2 bytes (16 bits)
Referential arrays - While performing indexing, slicing or copy, each copy is only just referneced from the original and not newly created all over again.
Dynamic arrays - Python will always allocate more memory dynamically as inputs keep coming than what's already needed, so it runs out of memory.
